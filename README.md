# findMatch

In today's day and age of dating applications, you're almost guaranteed to find this style of interaction.

I'll be starting from scratch and tackle this project in the below steps:

- Lay out the main UI of our app
- Include a container for cards that can be swiped left and right
- Integrate UIPanGestureRecognizer to control swiping behavior
- Enable animations for swiping off screen and cards entering screen
- Integrate animations for matching likes
